It tells the story of a human and a vampire who both attend Millennium Academy, a school for vampires and humans. Humans are protected here, and any assault on humans will result in punishment. Al, a vampire who is the son of the headmaster, is confronted by his father with a human boy, who he must protect. The human claims that he knows when the end of the world will occur. Subsequently, two moons form in the sky, signifying the end of the world. Now the pair, along with a few allies, must work together to protect the world where their races coexist.</p>
